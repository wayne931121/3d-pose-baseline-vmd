Please enter the full path of individual index directory.({Movie name}_json_{Execution date and time}_idx00)
There is a directory such as pos.txt.
This setting is available only in Half - width alphanumeric characters and is mandatory.
** Individual directory path: C:\TEST\testv\_json_3d_20251014_163924_idx01
--------------
Enter the relative or absolute path of the bone structure CSV file of the trace target model.
If nothing is entered and ENTER is pressed, the file of "born\animasa_miku_born.csv" is read.
** Bone structure CSV file:
--------------
Please output your feet with IK, or enter yes or no.
If you enter no, output it with FK
If nothing is entered and ENTER is pressed, it is output with IK.
** Foot IK Whether to output[yes/no]:
--------------
Please input the Y axis correction value of the heel with a numerical value (decimal possible).
Entering a negative value approaches the ground, entering a positive value moves away from the ground.
Although it corrects automatically to some extent automatically, if you can not correct it, please set it.
If you do not enter anything and press ENTER, no correction will be made.
You can set up to 5 items by separating them with a comma.
** Heel position correction:
--------------
Please enter the magnification multiplied by the center Z movement with a numerical value (decimal possible).
The smaller the value, the smaller the width of the center Z movement.
As a guide, it is better to reduce the magnification as the distance from the camera is shorter.
If nothing is entered and ENTER is pressed, processing is performed with the magnification "0".
When 0 is input, center Z axis movement is not performed.
You can set up to 5 items by separating them with a comma.
** Center Z moving magnification:
--------------
Specify the degree of motion smoothing
Please enter only an integer of 1 or more.
The larger the frequency, the smoother it is. (The behavior will be smaller instead)
If nothing is entered and ENTER is pressed, it smoothes 1 times.
You can set up to 5 items by separating them with a comma.
** Smoothing frequency:
--------------
Specify the amount of movement to be used for decimation of movement key (IK, center) with numerical value (decimal possible)
When there is a movement within the specified range, it is thinned out.
If nothing is entered and ENTER is pressed, thinning is performed with the movement amount of "0.5".
When moving thinning amount is set to 0, thinning is not performed.
You can set up to 5 items by separating them with a comma.
** Movement key thinning amount:
--------------
Specify the angle (decimal possible from 0 to 180 degrees) to be used for decimating rotation keys
It will be thinned out if there is a rotation within the specified angle.
If you do not enter anything and you press ENTER, 3 censor.
You can set up to 5 items by separating them with a comma.
** Rotating Key Culling Angle:
--------------
Please output detailed logs or enter yes or no.
If nothing is entered and ENTER is pressed, only the normal log is output.
��Detailed log[yes/no]: no
