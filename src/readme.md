# Warning

Warning: to success run the code, I used 5 hour to debug. but when I debug (at 20251013), I just "guess" what is this code doing and modify the error lines.

so if some code went error or it is not the originally meaning, you can modify by yourself.

what I modify:

https://github.com/wayne931121/3d-pose-baseline-vmd/blob/master/src/openpose_3dpose_sandbox_vmd.py#L110

and so on...

# Notice

- You should use only ansi encoding (english) in both path and filename, or it may cause error (in tensorflow file writer).
- If you file in C://, you should use administrator mode to run your script, or you don't have write permission.
- If you env in C://, you should use administrator mode to install and build packages, or you don't have write permission.

# MY DEBUG TOOLS

## Cdebug
- a python_debug_repl tool, write by me (wayne931121) .
- https://pypi.org/project/cdebug/

## Isdebug
- a debug tool when pip install requirements.txt, write by me (wayne931121) .
- https://pypi.org/project/isdebug/

## Wfind
- a useful tool for find file or folder, when I use the script not written by me, and I don't know where the output is, I directly use this code to search C disk, I am very satisfied with this code because it is more faster than windows file exploer.
