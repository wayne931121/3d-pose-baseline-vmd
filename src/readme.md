# Warning

Warning: to success run the code, I used 5 hour to debug. but when I debug (at 20251013), I just "guess" what is this code doing and modify the error lines.

so if some code went error or it is not the originally meaning, you can modify by yourself.

what I modify:

https://github.com/wayne931121/3d-pose-baseline-vmd/blob/master/src/openpose_3dpose_sandbox_vmd.py#L110

and so on...

# Notice

You should use only ansi encoding (english) in both path and filename, or it may cause error (tensorflow file writer).

# Conclusion

Finally the code success run and I success get vmd file
